    <div class="question">
      What experience (if any) do you have with programming?
      (None is fine!)
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

      I took two semesters of computer music in undergrad (we used MAX/MSP and Csound) and I've also learned a little bit of Python.

    <div class="question">
      What's something you'd like to be able to build/do with programming?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

      I'm not sure what I would like to be to build, but since I'd like to work as a game composer, I'd like to be able to speak the same language as the programmers I'm collaborating with.

    <h1>Think Like a Programmer</h1>
    <div class="question">
      Pretend you are writing a plugin that automatically harmonizes with MIDI input.
      What instructions would you give a computer to do this programmatically?
    </div><br>
    <div class="answer">

      1) Identify the midi note value of the original input.<br>
      2) Find the note that is 4 midi notes (semitones) higher than the original input.<br>
      3) Play this new pitch for the same duration that the original pitch is played.

    </div><br>
    <div class="question">
      Pick an instrument and pretend you are writing an app that mimics that instrument.
      How would you model the instrument in a way the computer would understand?
      Think about what different objects (e.g. "string" for a guitar) it might
      need and what properties (e.g. "pitch"), events (e.g. "pluck"),
      and methods (e.g. "playPitch()") would be useful.
    </div><br>
    <div class="answer">

      Instrument: Saxophone<br>
      Objects: body, neck, mouthpiece, reed, ligature<br>
      Properties: pitch, duration, dynamic<br>
      Events: articulation type (stacatto, marcato, accent, slur), vibrato<br>
      Methods: playPitch (articulation type), stop(), tempo(), breathe()<br><br>
